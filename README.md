D3Dash
======

D3Dash is a dashboarding framework based on the d3.js library. 

To get started, create an HTML file that includes the JavaScript files in the src/components folder. Optionally include the stylesheet from src/stylesheets (this will make several components of the charts look better.)

You will also need the d3.js library, which is available here: https://github.com/mbostock/d3

Examples and documentation will be available soon!
